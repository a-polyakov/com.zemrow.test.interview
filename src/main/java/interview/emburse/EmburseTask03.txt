Consider you have student and class tables in DB, not all students are enrolled in classes.
Make a query to get students that are enrolled in at least 2 classes

Scheme:
students(id, name)
class(id, name)
students_class(id, student_id, class_id)

select s.id, s.name, count(sc.class_id)
from students s
join students_class sc on sc.student_id = s.id
group by s.id, s.name
having count(sc.class_id) > 2
