Design an API that will create/update expense reports and provide audit trail for each action
• expense reports: When you do business travel, you will create expense like flight, car renting and hotel fee.
  An expense report includes all the expense in the travel, like the expense item (flight/car renting/hotel),
  transaction date, fee amount
• audit trail: all the actions when creating or updating expense report, like who and when the expense reports
  are created and updated

Architecture
 A microservice-compatible architecture, but starting as a modular monolith. We follow Domain-Driven Design.
Backend
 Java with Spring Boot, API documentation via OpenAPI (Swagger).
Database
 PostgreSQL with a replica.
Nginx at the entry point (certificates, load balancing, DDoS protection).

for developers, create a docker composer file to run all the necessary infrastructure locally.

When scaling is needed, first increase the number of application instances.
Move read-only load to the replica.
Set up CI/CD.
Add seamless (zero-downtime) updates: run 3 nodes, take 1 out of Nginx, update it, direct part of the load to it, and if everything is fine, update the rest.
Integrate monitoring and logging systems.
Add distributed cache (Redis).

When the domain model is stable and user load is understood, extract modules that need to be separated (microservices with gRPC).
If full-text search is required, add Elasticsearch (OpenSearch).
when the workload for generating reports increases, use specialized tools for this, гse OLAP or ClickHouse for reporting systems.
Messaging
 For building processing chains, use queues—RabbitMQ, and Kafka if possible.
General Approach
The further complexity of the system depends on the specific application.
There is no silver bullet: what worked for others may not work for you.
The best strategy is to test different solutions under conditions close to production—using obfuscated production data and emulated user load.
